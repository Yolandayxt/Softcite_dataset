# Softcite dataset Exploration 
Our project aims to dig and explore the corpus dataset (Source: https://github.com/howisonlab/softcite-dataset/blob/master/data/corpus/softcite_corpus-full.tei.xml) 

Original repository containing dataset with its description: https://github.com/howisonlab/softcite-dataset

We'd like to compare the frequency of each software mentions in the dataset with those in article. A csv file (https://github.com/Yolandayxt/Softcite_dataset/blob/main/Softcite%20%20-%20First%20Ten%20Article.csv) has been uploaded as a summary for the first ten articles with their software mentions in dataset and original publications separately.
